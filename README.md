# Headliner App

## Description
Headliner is a music event search app. This was built alongside the Ticket Master API. The user can search keywords for concert events in their area or by artist.

## Status
Currently this app is functioning. A live demo can be found at this [**link**](https://josevillaprz.github.io/headliner-app/) As of July 2022, I have refactored this application. A few things I implemented and improved are:

* Semantic Tags
* React Best Practices
* Layout
* Components
* File Structure

## How to install

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/josevillaprz/headliner-app.git`
2. Run `npm install` in the root folder
3. Run `npm start`
